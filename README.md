## Task

This project implements a survey application with the following functionality:

- Screens for each survey question.
- Logic to navigate between questions based on user responses.
- Storage of user responses.

## Requirements

- Use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/pLPedeHKj4l1wxtfy8IWO4/OBRIO_Front_End_Test?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=QpwHBD4vXFeg99dp-0) to create pages.
- Pages should be responsive for mobile and desktop (tablet view is not required). No pixel-perfect design is required.
- Pages must be generated using Next.js `generateStaticParams` (App Router).
- Store user responses in a state manager.
- The survey configuration (questions, answers, navigation conditions) must be stored in a separate JSON file and be flexible.
- Dynamic placeholders such as ‚Äú{Gender}‚Äù must be displayed based on answers from previous screens.
- After completing the survey, user responses must be displayed (in any convenient format).

## Flexibility Considerations

- Assume there will be 10 different survey configurations in the project.
- Each question screen should not rely on responses from previous or future screens. There should be no hardcoded dependencies.
- The project should support adding new screen types, such as a date input field, by leveraging the `screenType` field in the survey configuration.

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd obrio-questionnaire
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open the application in your browser:

## Features

1. **Dynamic Question Screens**:

    - Screens are generated dynamically using the configuration JSON file.
    - Each screen type is defined by `screenType` to support extensibility.

2. **State Management**:

    - User responses are managed using RTK, ensuring scalability and performance.

3. **Flexible Configuration**:

    - All questions, answers, and navigation logic are defined in a single JSON file for easy customization.

4. **Dynamic Placeholder Replacement**:

    - Dynamic values such as `{Gender}` are populated based on user responses.
    - Placeholder logic ensures screens remain independent of each other.

5. **Responsive Design**:

    - The application is optimized for mobile and desktop devices.

## JSON Configuration Example

Below is an example of a survey question configuration:

```json
{
  "id": "q1",
  "screenType": "singleChoice",
  "question": "Select your gender:",
   "placeholders": {
      "Gender": "q2",
      "who_have_children": {
         "condition": 5,
         "valueIfTrue": "who have children",
         "valueIfFalse": ""
      }
   },
   "answers": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Male", "reference": "q2" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Female", "reference": "q2" }
  ]
}
```

## Linting and Formatting

- Run ESLint and Prettier:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
